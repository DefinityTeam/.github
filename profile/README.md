# Welcome to the Definity GitHub profile
We make things that [respect humanity](#respecting-humanity). But we're more than that:
- We've got wild opinions. Some of us call it [free/libre software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html), while others call it [open source software](https://opensource.org/osd). 
- We try not to take ourselves too seriously. [A look on our Twitter can show you that](https://twitter.com/DefinityORG) (assuming we've actually posted something there in the past 6 months, of course.)

## Respecting Humanity
We respect humanity by working to ensure:
- **Your right to privacy.** This right is what we were founded on. Most software today is not private-- and there are too many cases to even list here, but the most basic, and sadly common, is selling *your* data to the highest bidder. At Definity, we find these practices *unacceptable*. So not only do we make products that you can verify are truly protecting your privacy, but we also go the extra mile and help make and support new emerging standards that are genuinely good for your privacy.
- **Your right to breathe.** This right is important to not just us, but *many* other companies. It's important to recognize that everyone directly *and* indirectly hurts ourselves and our environment, but even more so to recognize it and do something about it. At Definity, we make our products with the environment in mind, and aim for green wherever possible. If we can't go green yet, we'll plan it out and make sure getting to that stage is a high priority.
- **Your right to exist.** Even if you don't like a certain group of people, we believe there is no excuse or reason that would validate death or censorship solely based upon the color of someone's skin, sexual orientation, nor anything else that diversifies. We recognize that other companies solely do it for the pride marketing, and that's horribly appalling. We'll donate and help out wherever we can, even when it's not Juneteenth.

## Our Aims
- **We aim to create software that helps you, while also keeping the company alive.** Our service hosting is always provided by companies that commit to user experience and the environment. 
- **We aim to keep all software, firmware, hardware and documents that we create and recieve publicly available** (or, if possible, redistributable). This includes internal company deals. We keep everything as transparent as possible, so you can ensure that we aren't doing anything that may hurt you.
- **We aim to keep prices affordable for everybody.** No matter what the country, financial situation or anything else that could affect a purchase, you should be able to use our products. We try to create free trials so people can test out any of our paid services, however we try to keep a free version available to everyone where possible and affordable.
- **We aim to create the best possible work experience for our employees/volunteers.** We allow them to work their own hours and take breaks, keeping them motivated. We encourage any and all who work with us to speak out if they have a problem.
