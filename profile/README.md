# Welcome to the Definity GitHub profile
We aim to make FOSS software that [respects humanity](#respecting-humanity). But we're more than that:
- We've got wild opinions. Some of us call it [free/libre software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html), while others call it [open source software](https://opensource.org/osd). [TODO: add more opinions]
- We try not to take ourselves too seriously. [A look on our Twitter can show you that](https://twitter.com/DefinityORG) (assuming we've actually posted something there in the past 6 months, of course.)

## Respecting Humanity
We respect humanity by working to ensure:
- **Your right to privacy.** This right is what we were founded on. Most software today is not private-- and there are too many cases to even list here, but the most basic, and sadly common, is selling *your* data to the highest bidder. At Definity, we find these practices *unacceptable*. So not only do we make products that you can verify are truly protecting your privacy, but we also go the extra mile and help make and support new emerging standards that are genuinely good for your privacy.
- **Your right to breathe.** This right is important to not just us, but *many* other companies. It's important to recognize that everyone directly *and* indirectly hurts ourselves and our environment, but even more so to recognize it and do something about it. At Definity, we make our products with the environment in mind, and aim for green wherever possible. If we can't go green yet, we'll make it a priority to ensure that we get there.
- **Your right to exist.** Even if you don't like a certain group of people, we believe there is no excuse or reason that would validate death or censorship solely based upon the color of someone's skin nor their sexual orientation. We recognize that other companies solely do it for the pride marketing, and that's horribly appalling. We'll donate and help out wherever we can, even when it's not Juneteenth.
