# Localization policy
Localization is a large part of keeping products supported for as many people as possible. However, a lot of people cannot speak every language. Our policy is simple: if an employee/volunteer at Definity cannot provide support for the product in that language, the language simply won't be supported. <br>
Here is the current list of languages supported
| code | name |
|---|---|
| `en-*` | English (all) |
| `hu` | Hungarian |
| `cnm` | Mandarin (Simplified Chinese) | <br>
While we appreciate that having products in many languages will allow for better usage, we simply cannot support a language that we cannot provide support in.
